This repository contains the data and code for the data-poor stock assessment analysis conducted in support of the following paper:

Elsler LG, Oostdijk M, Zhao J, Free CM, Tekwa EW, Bochniewicz EM, Gephart JA, Johnson AF. Global trade network patterns coupled to marine fisheries sustainability. *Near submission* to _PNAS_.

The repository is organized using the following structure:

- **DATA** - A folder containing the raw data, the code used to process the raw data, and the data generated from the processing
- **CODE** - A folder containing the code used to analyze the processed data and prepare tables/figures
- **TABLES** - A folder containing tables generated for the project
- **FIGURES** - A folder containing figures generated for the project

This project was funded as part of a [SESYNC Graduate Pursuit](https://www.sesync.org/opportunities/research-graduate-pursuit/graduate-pursuits-request-for-proposals): "Cross-scale exploitation patterns and marine population collapse in international seafood markets".

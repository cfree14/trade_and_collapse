Bilateral trade and fisheries exploitation - SESYNC graduate student pursuit

This repository is home to the data and code being used for the SESYNC graduate student pursuit: "Cross-scale exploitation patterns and marine population collapse in international seafood markets"

The project is organized using the following structure:

DATA - A folder containing the raw data, the code used to process the raw data, and the data generated from the processing
CODE - A folder containing the code used to analyze the processed data and prepare tables/figures
TABLES - A folder containing tables generated for the project
FIGURES - A foldeer containing figures generated for the project

Currently, I am working on generating time series of B/BMSY for ~800 FAO "stocks" (area-species couples). This work is being done in DATA > FAO_LANDINGS.
